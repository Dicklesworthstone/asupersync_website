# Structured Concurrency Macro DSL

This document describes the Asupersync macro DSL for structured concurrency:
`#[main]`, `#[test]`, `scope!`, `spawn!`, `join!`, `join_all!`, `race!`, and
`select!`.

The macros are designed to reduce boilerplate while preserving Asupersync
invariants: structured concurrency, cancellation correctness, and deterministic
testing.

## Enable Macros

The macro DSL ships in the default feature set, so a standard dependency is
enough. If you disable default features, re-enable `proc-macros` explicitly.

```toml
[dependencies]
asupersync = { path = "." }
```

```toml
[dependencies]
asupersync = { path = ".", default-features = false, features = ["proc-macros"] }
```

```rust
use asupersync::proc_macros::{join, join_all, main, race, scope, spawn, test};
```

## Supported Contract

| Macro | `proc-macros` build | No-`proc-macros` build | Current semantics |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| `scope!` | Supported and re-exported by `asupersync` | Unavailable | Binds a `Scope` for the current region; does not create a fresh child-region boundary |
| `spawn!` | Supported and re-exported by `asupersync` | Unavailable | Expands to `Scope::spawn_registered`; requires ambient `__state` and `__cx` |
| `join!` | Supported and re-exported by `asupersync` | Contract-enforcement `compile_error!` fallback | Polls all branches concurrently in one `poll_fn`; pending branches never block ready ones |
| `join_all!` | Supported and re-exported by `asupersync` | Unavailable | Concurrent like `join!`, returns an array (branches share one type) |
| `race!` | Supported and re-exported by `asupersync` | Contract-enforcement `compile_error!` fallback | Expands to `Cx::race_drained*`; losers are protocol-cancelled **and drained** |
| `select!` | Supported and re-exported by `asupersync` | Contract-enforcement `compile_error!` fallback | N-ary heterogeneous select; blocking form drains losers via `Cx::race_drained`, optional `else` arm is a non-blocking Go-style default |
| `#[main]` / `#[test]` | Supported and re-exported by `asupersync` | Unavailable | Runs async entry functions on the production runtime and optionally injects the installed root `Cx` |
| `#[lab_test]` | Supported and re-exported by `asupersync` | Unavailable | Runs deterministic lab tests under one seed or a seed matrix and fails with seed/rerun details |

`session_protocol!` and `#[conformance]` exist in `asupersync-macros`, but they
are not part of the root `asupersync` macro contract.

`#[main]` and `#[test]` are production-runtime entry attributes. They build an
`asupersync::runtime::Runtime`, call `block_on`, and allow an optional
`cx: &Cx` parameter that is bound from the root context installed by `block_on`.
They accept `flavor`, `workers`, `budget`, `blocking`, and `drain_ms` arguments
and reject unsupported signatures at macro expansion time.

When paired with a runtime that provides `Runtime::drain_root_region`, the
macros drain the root region after the entry future returns: every task that
outlived the entry future is protocol-cancelled with `CancelKind::Shutdown`
and given `drain_ms` (default 2000) to run its cleanup before teardown drops
whatever is still running. `drain_ms = 0` restores drop-at-teardown.

Published older `0.4.x` runtimes, including `0.4.3`, can resolve newer macro
versions but do not provide that drain API. When `drain_ms` is omitted, the
macros preserve those runtimes' drop-at-teardown behavior. An explicit positive
`drain_ms` requires the real runtime API and fails to compile if it is absent.
The `tests/fixtures/entry-macro-compat-v043` consumer checks unchanged `main`
and `test` annotations against published runtime `=0.4.3`; its `explicit-drain`
feature is a negative compile canary that must report the missing drain method.

Defaults differ by attribute, mirroring tokio: `#[main]` builds
`RuntimeBuilder::multi_thread()` (the host-independent default worker count,
currently 4; pass `workers = N` or `flavor = "current_thread"` to change it),
while `#[test]` builds `RuntimeBuilder::current_thread()` so test bodies stay
replay-stable. Both configure an on-demand blocking pool
(`blocking_threads(0, 512)`) so `spawn_blocking` offloads to a dedicated thread;
`blocking = N` changes the cap and `blocking = 0` restores the inline behaviour
of a bare `RuntimeBuilder`, which ships without a pool.

```rust
use asupersync::{Cx, main};

#[main(flavor = "current_thread", workers = 1, budget = 128)]
async fn main(cx: &Cx) -> Result<(), asupersync::Error> {
    cx.checkpoint()?;
    Ok(())
}
```

`#[test]` uses the same production runtime path under the Rust test harness:

```rust
use asupersync::{Cx, test};

#[test(flavor = "multi_thread", workers = 2)]
async fn production_runtime_smoke(cx: &Cx) {
    cx.checkpoint().expect("checkpoint");
}
```

`#[lab_test]` wraps deterministic lab tests in a fixed seed or seed matrix,
initializes test logging, drives the lab to quiescence, and fails with the exact
seed plus a rerun command when the body, oracle report, or invariant report
fails.

```rust
use asupersync::{lab::LabRuntime, lab_test};

#[lab_test(seeds = 0..16)]
fn invariant_matrix(lab: &mut LabRuntime) {
    assert!(lab.config().seed < 16);
}
```

Async root-task form receives a `&Cx` and is run through
`lab::run_async_under_lab_with_config`:

```rust
use asupersync::{cx::Cx, lab_test};

#[lab_test(seeds = 7..9, chaos)]
async fn cancel_path(cx: &Cx) {
    cx.checkpoint().expect("checkpoint");
}
```

Initial porting evidence for `asupersync-lab-dx-v2-n2v2fi.1`: six
representative `src/lab/runtime.rs` tests now use
`#[asupersync::lab_test(seeds = 42..43)]`:
`empty_runtime_is_quiescent`, `advance_time`, `advance_to_next_timer_empty`,
`clock_pause_resume`, `inject_clock_skew`, and
`auto_advance_quiescent_termination`. Their repeated raw setup/completion
boilerplate moved from 18 lines (`init_test`, `LabRuntime::{with_seed,new}`,
and `test_complete!`) to 6 attribute lines, a 67% reduction for that setup
block.

## Quick Start (Runnable)

This snippet is runnable as an example binary through the production runtime
entry macro:

```rust
use asupersync::{Cx, main};

#[main]
async fn main(cx: &Cx) {
    cx.checkpoint().expect("checkpoint");
}
```

## Phase 0 Status Notes

The macro DSL is usable today, but its semantics are narrower than the long-term
design target. Keep the following in mind:

- `scope!` currently calls `Cx::scope()` and binds the existing region. If you
  need a fresh child-region boundary with quiescence on exit, use
  `Scope::region(...)` explicitly.
- `spawn!` requires a `__state: &mut RuntimeState` variable to exist in scope.
  The supported path is `scope!(cx, state: ..., { ... })`.
- `race!` expands to the drain-correct `Cx::race_drained*` methods: each branch
  is spawned as a region task and resolved through `Scope::race_all`, so every
  loser is protocol-cancelled **and drained** (awaited to termination) before
  the macro returns. Branches and their outputs must therefore be `Send +
  'static`, and `cx` must carry spawn authority. The lower-level drop-on-cancel
  `Cx::race*` methods remain as an escape hatch for non-`'static` inline races.
- `select!` is the heterogeneous, N-ary member of the race family. Its blocking
  form rewrites each `pat = fut => handler` branch into a single homogeneous
  `async move { let pat = fut.await; handler }` future and routes the list
  through `Cx::race_drained`, inheriting the **loser-drain** guarantee. A
  trailing `else => handler` arm switches it to a non-blocking, poll-once
  Go-style default that does **not** drain (documented opt-out). See the
  `select!` reference below for the full tie-break/determinism contract.
- `join!` and `join_all!` poll all branches concurrently in a single `poll_fn`:
  each branch is pinned once and only not-yet-ready branches are re-polled per
  wake, so N same-duration sleeps complete in one duration, not the sum.

These are *phase limitations*, not permanent API choices.

## Macro Reference

### scope!

Create a `Scope` binding for the current region. The macro binds a `scope`
variable inside the body.

**Syntax**

```rust
scope!(cx, { ... })
scope!(cx, "name", { ... })
scope!(cx, budget: Budget::INFINITE, { ... })
scope!(cx, "name", budget: Budget::INFINITE, { ... })
```

**Expansion (conceptual)**

```rust
{
    let __cx = &cx;
    let __scope = __cx.scope();
    async move {
        let scope = __scope;
        /* body */
    }.await
}
```

**Notes**

- `scope!` always inserts `.await`, so it must be invoked inside an async context.
- `scope!` does not create a fresh child region today.
- `return` is rejected inside the body. Use early-return patterns instead.

### spawn!

Spawn work inside the current `scope`.

**Syntax**

```rust
spawn!(future)
spawn!("name", future)
spawn!(scope, future)
spawn!(scope, "name", future)
```

**Expansion (conceptual)**

```rust
scope.spawn_registered(__state, __cx, |cx| async move { future.await })
```

**Notes**

- `spawn!` expects `__state: &mut RuntimeState` and `__cx: &Cx` to be in scope.
- `scope!(..., state: ..., { ... })` is the supported way to introduce `__state`.
- The handle is returned immediately; scheduling is handled by the runtime.

### join!

Join multiple futures and return a tuple of results.

**Syntax**

```rust
join!(f1, f2, f3)
join!(cx; f1, f2, f3)
```

**Notes**

- Polls all branches concurrently in a single `poll_fn`: each branch is pinned
  once and only the not-yet-ready branches are re-polled per wake, so a pending
  branch never blocks the others. Three 10ms sleeps complete in ~10ms, not 30ms.
- `cx;` is type-checked and reserved for cancellation propagation; the concurrent
  polling itself needs no scheduler support.

### join_all!

Join multiple futures and return an array.

**Syntax**

```rust
join_all!(f1, f2, f3)
```

**Notes**

- All futures must return the same type.
- Useful when you want to iterate results.
- Concurrent, like `join!`: the same single-`poll_fn` expansion, returning an
  array instead of a tuple.

### race!

Race inline futures and return the first completion. Losers are
protocol-cancelled **and drained** — awaited to termination — before the macro
returns, so obligations and finalizers a loser holds are resolved, not
abandoned. This drain guarantee is the differentiator versus a plain
drop-the-losers select (e.g. `tokio::select!`).

**Syntax**

```rust
// Factory form (preferred): each branch receives its own child `Cx`.
race!(cx, { move |child| fetch(&child, a), move |child| fetch(&child, b) })
race!(cx, { "fast" => move |child| f1(child), "slow" => move |child| f2(child) })
race!(cx, timeout: Duration::from_secs(5), { move |child| f1(child), move |child| f2(child) })

// Prebuilt-future form
race!(cx, { f1, f2 })
race!(cx, { "fast" => f1, "slow" => f2 })
race!(cx, timeout: Duration::from_secs(5), { f1, f2 })
```

**Notes**

- Expands to the drain-correct `Cx::race_drained*` methods (`race_drained_with*`
  for the factory form): each branch is spawned as a region task and resolved
  through `Scope::race_all`. Every branch must use the same form.
- Branches and their outputs must be `Send + 'static`, and `cx` must carry spawn
  authority (a runtime-wired context).
- Semantics: the winner returns first; every loser is cancelled and drained.
- Each branch runs in its own child region of the caller's region. Once the
  race resolves, everything a losing branch spawned through its own context
  (and their descendants) is cancelled and awaited before the race returns;
  on a failed race (owner cancellation, admission failure) that covers every
  branch. Tasks the winner spawned keep running, and the winner's region
  closes by itself once they finish. A caller region with admission limits
  keeps branches directly in that region, so its limits still apply.
- **A branch must use its own context to observe loser cancellation.** Loser
  cancellation targets the branch's task. A prebuilt future that awaits a
  cancel-aware operation on the caller's `cx` (for example `rx.recv(&cx)`) never
  sees it, so the drain waits until that branch finishes on its own. Use the
  factory form and pass `child` to the branch's operations, or call
  `Cx::current()` inside the branch.
- Owner cancellation: if the task awaiting `race!` is cancelled while every
  branch is still pending, that cancellation is forwarded to all branches, they
  are drained, and the race returns `Err(JoinError::Cancelled(_))` with the
  owner's reason. A branch panic still takes precedence.
- `timeout:` with the factory form cancels and drains every branch when the
  deadline passes and returns `Err(JoinError::Cancelled(_))` with a timeout
  reason. With prebuilt futures an elapsed deadline abandons the race by drop.
- For a lower-level drop-on-cancel select over non-`'static` inline futures,
  call `Cx::race*` directly.

### select!

Select over **heterogeneous** branches — each branch awaits its own future type
and runs a handler arm; every handler must yield the same result type. `select!`
lifts the fixed `Race2`/`Race3`/`Race4` arity ceiling and is the drain-correct
alternative to `tokio::select!`.

**Syntax**

```rust
// blocking, drain-correct → Result<R, JoinError>
let r = select!(cx, {
    a = primary.fetch()  => use_primary(a),
    b = backup.fetch()   => use_backup(b),
})?;

// explicit tie-break marker
let r = select!(cx, biased, {
    a = fast()  => a,
    b = slow()  => b,
})?;

// non-blocking Go-style default → R
let r = select!(cx, {
    a = try_recv() => a,
    else => default_value(),
});
```

**Two forms**

- **Blocking** (no `else`): each `pat = fut => handler` branch is rewritten into
  `async move { let pat = fut.await; handler }`, and the homogeneous per-branch
  list routes through `Cx::race_drained`. The first branch to win resolves the
  macro; every loser is protocol-cancelled **and drained** before it returns.
  Resolves to `Result<R, JoinError>`. Branch futures and `R` must be
  `Send + 'static`, and `cx` must carry spawn authority. As with `race!`, a
  branch may be a child-context factory (`pat = move |child| work(child) =>
  handler`), and every branch must then use that form. Use it whenever a branch
  awaits a cancel-aware operation, so the operation observes loser and owner
  cancellation on its own context.
- **Non-blocking default** (trailing `else => handler`): each branch is polled
  **exactly once** in source order; the first ready branch wins, otherwise the
  `else` handler runs immediately. This never waits, so it does **not** drain —
  the not-ready branches are dropped. Resolves to `R`.

**Determinism / tie-break**

- Every `select!` is replay-deterministic: same seed ⇒ same winner.
- The blocking form breaks same-turn ties with the runtime drain engine's
  **seeded** scheduler RNG (`Scope::race_all`) — fixed by the seed, not by
  source position, so a different seed may pick a different same-turn winner.
- The `else` form polls in strict **source order** (first listed ready branch
  wins, seed-independent).
- `biased` is accepted on the blocking form for `tokio::select!` familiarity and
  documents that selection is deterministic; it does not impose strict source
  order — use the `else` form for that.

## Patterns

### Fan-out / fan-in

```rust,ignore
scope!(cx, state: &mut state, {
    let h1 = spawn!(async { fetch_a().await });
    let h2 = spawn!(async { fetch_b().await });
    let (a, b) = join!(h1, h2);
    (a, b)
})
```

### Timeout wrapper

```rust,ignore
let value = race!(cx, timeout: Duration::from_secs(2), {
    long_operation(),
    async { Err(TimeoutError) },
});
```

### Nested scopes with tighter budgets

```rust,ignore
scope!(cx, state: &mut state, {
    scope!(cx, budget: Budget::with_deadline_secs(5), {
        // inner work with tighter budget
    });
})
```

### Fan-out over borrowed data: fibers

There is no fiber macro; `cx::fiber::scope` is a plain function. Use it when
the number of children is dynamic, when they borrow the caller's data, or when
each child needs its own cancellation:

```rust,ignore
let words = &words;
let letters = fiber::scope(|scope| async move {
    let handles: Vec<_> = words
        .iter()
        .map(|word| scope.spawn(async move { word.len() }))
        .collect();
    let mut letters = 0;
    for handle in handles {
        letters += handle.await.expect("fiber finished");
    }
    letters
})
.await;
```

Fibers run inside the calling task, like the branches of `join!`, so they are
concurrent but not parallel. Unlike the branches of `race!`, they are not
region tasks: they need no `'static` bound and no spawn authority. The scope
returns only after every fiber has finished:
- the task's cancellation reaches every fiber;
- `FiberHandle::cancel` stops one fiber;
- a panicking fiber cancels its siblings.

The complete program is
[`examples/fibers_borrowing.rs`](../examples/fibers_borrowing.rs).

## Migration Guide

Manual API usage (today):

```rust,ignore
let scope = cx.scope();
let handle = scope.spawn_registered(&mut state, &cx, |cx| async move { work(cx).await })?;
let result = handle.join(&cx).await?;
```

Macro DSL (current supported surface):

```rust,ignore
scope!(cx, state: &mut state, {
    let handle = spawn!(async { work(cx).await });
    let result = handle.await;
    result
})
```
